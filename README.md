# Computational-Illumination-for-Stop-Motion  

**Main Idea**  
Interpolate view and lighting of stop-motion scenes
  
**Motivation**  
Specifically stop-motion because we can capture different lighting and views per frame, not possible in real time capture. Post production fix or stylistic choice for camera angle and lighting
  
**Final Product**  
Application demo of view and lighting interpolation of captured scene with different angles and lighting
